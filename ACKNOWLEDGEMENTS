The French language analysis in mimic has been written mainly by Sergio Oller.

The lexicon and the letter to sound rules were built using a very naive script and need
to be reviewed as there are known errors.

The original data (without so many errors) is based on the corpus from
The SIWIS French Speech Synthesis Database under CC-BY 4.0.
